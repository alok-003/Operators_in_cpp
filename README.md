# Operators in C++
Experiment 3

# AIM
To use operators to add two numbers.

# Theory
Airthmetic operators are symbols used in programming to perform operations on variables and values. They are important to writing expressions and making decisions in code.

# Types:
Addition (+): Adds two operands. Example: a + b Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first. Example: a - b Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands. Example: a * b Division (/): Divides the numerator by the denominator. Example: a / b Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation. Example: a % b
